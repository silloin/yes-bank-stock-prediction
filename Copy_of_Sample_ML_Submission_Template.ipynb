        "This project focuses on predicting the closing price of Yes Bank stock using various supervised machine learning models. The objective was to analyze historical stock price data, derive insights through visualization, and implement predictive models to accurately forecast the closing price based on features such as Open, High, and Low prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "📊 Data Analysis & Preprocessing\n",
        "The dataset used consists of Yes Bank stock prices over time. Initial data analysis included checking the structure of the dataset, column types, shape, and null values. Several preprocessing steps were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling:\n",
        "\n",
        "Datetime parsing: The Date column was converted to datetime format and set as the index.\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing value treatment: Missing values were handled using forward fill and mean imputation methods to maintain time-series integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outlier detection: Outliers were identified using boxplots and treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. In some cases, winsorization (capping) was used to retain useful data while reducing noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature Engineering: New features such as Price_Range (High – Low) and Month were derived. Categorical features like Month were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset was scaled and split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split.\n",
        "\n",
        "📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
        "Over 15 insightful visualizations were created to understand patterns and correlations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Line and area plots displayed the trends of Open, High, Low, and Close over time.\n",

        "Boxplots and histograms were used to study price distributions and detect outliers.\n",

        "Pair plots visualized the joint distributions of all price features.\n",

        "🤖 Machine Learning Models\n",
        "Three supervised learning models were implemented and evaluated:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Model 1: Linear Regression\n",
        "A baseline model using Open, High, and Low as features.\n",
        "\n",
        "R² Score: 0.9904 | MAE: ~5.81\n",
        "\n",
        "Though simple, it provided a surprisingly strong performance on this structured dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Model 2: Ridge Regression with GridSearchCV\n",
        "Used L2 regularization and hyperparameter tuning for alpha.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuned using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Slightly improved accuracy and reduced overfitting compared to linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Model 3: Random Forest Regressor\n",
        "Ensemble method capturing non-linear relationships effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outperformed all other models with the highest R² and lowest MAE/RMSE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robust to noise and outliers, making it ideal for stock price prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 Conclusion\n",
        "All models performed well, but Random Forest delivered the best overall accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature importance showed that High and Low prices are strong predictors of Close.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project confirmed that the closing price can be reliably predicted using only Open, High, and Low prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow included complete EDA, outlier treatment, missing value imputation, encoding, feature engineering, model training, tuning, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "📦 Final Thoughts\n",
        "This project demonstrates how a structured ML pipeline can be applied to financial data. With further enhancements like incorporating volume, macro indicators, or advanced models like XGBoost or LSTM, prediction accuracy could improve even further.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is now ready to be deployed or integrated into a real-time prediction system."
